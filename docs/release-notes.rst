  2.5b2 and later.
* Added ``doj.test.xmlrunner.junitxmlrunner``, a Django test runner for
  producing JUnit-compatible XML output (useful for integration with continous
  integration tools like hudson, cruise-control, etc).
* war command: ``--include-py-libs`` option has been renamed to
  ``--include-py-path-entries`` to avoid misinterpretations. Also added the
  ``--include-py-packages`` option.
* Bugfixes for all reported issues.
