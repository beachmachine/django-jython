Welcome to Django-Jython's documentation!
=========================================

Django-Jython is a collection of tools to use the `Django
<http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ web framework on top of `Jython
<http://www.jython.org>`_. 

It allows you to mix the awesome development speed of Django with the richness
and robustness of the Java platform.
