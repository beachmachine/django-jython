QuickStart
==========

Install
-------

To get started with using django-jython, first install it following these steps:

 - Grab the `latest django-jython distribution
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-jython>`_
 - Uncompress it
 - Move into the resulting directory
 - Run ``jython setup.py``

.. note::

   If you already have `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ installed on
   Jython, you can use it instead of the manual process detailed above. The
   output looks like this::
   
     $ /path/to/jyton/bin/pip install django-jython
   
     Downloading/unpacking django-jython
       Downloading django-jython-1.7a1.tar.gz
       Running setup.py egg_info for package django-jython
     Installing collected packages: django-jython
       Running setup.py install for django-jython
     Successfully installed django-jython


Database backends
-----------------

Then, if you want to use the JDBC backends change the ``settings.py`` file of
your project and set::

  DATABASES = {
    'default': {
      ...
      'ENGINE': 'doj.db.backends.postgresql',
    }
  }

Or::

  DATABASES = {
    'default': {
      ...
      'ENGINE': 'doj.db.backends.sqlite',
    }
  }

Or::

  DATABASES = {
    'default': {
      ...
      'ENGINE': 'doj.db.backends.mysql',
    }
  }

Or::

  DATABASES = {
    'default': {
      ...
      'ENGINE': 'doj.db.backends.mssql',
    }
  }

Depending on which database you want to use. Remember to have the JAR file
containing the JDBC driver for each database somewhere in your
``CLASSPATH``. For example, you can do that on Unix-based system by running::

  export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:/path/to/postgresql-9.1-902.jdbc4.jar"

Django and Jython
-----------------

The minimal required version of Jython to make Django work is 2.7b2. As this version
is still in development there are some bugs and incompatibilities we need to work around.
For this reason django-jython comes with some patches that are applied on runtime (this means
you do **not** need to modify the sources of Django or Jython). django-jython tries to
automatically apply these patches as early as possible, but sometimes this mechanism
fails. To make sure the patching works, add these lines to the **very top** of
the ``manage.py`` file of your application::

  #!/usr/bin/env python
  from doj.monkey import install_monkey_patches
  install_monkey_patches()

  # Usual content of manage.py...

Building a .war file
--------------------

To build a war archive for deployment into Java application servers, change
``settings.py`` on your project to include ``'doj'``. For example::

  INSTALLED_APPS = (
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.sites',
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'mysite.polls',
      'mysite.another_app',
      # More apps...
      'doj',
  )

Then you can build a war file running ``jython manage.py buildwar`` on your project
directory.

For a complete documentation on building war files see :ref:`war-deployment`.
