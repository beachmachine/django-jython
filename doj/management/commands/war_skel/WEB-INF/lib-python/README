This directory is treated specially by modjy. Firstly, lib-python is added
to `sys.path`, which means that any python libraries you wish to use can be
dropped in here, and they will automatically become available to your code.
Secondly, the directory is searched for python `.pth` files. These files are
simple text files, each line of which is added directly to sys.path. So if
you want to use `.jar` files, `.zip` files or `.egg` files containing python
code, you should create a text file, whose name ends with .pth, listing each
of those files, one per line, and place the file in the lib-python directory.
All files in the lib-python directory whose names end with .pth are scanned.
