This is a Jython package to provide a jTDS backend to Django that is
specific to Microsoft SQL Server 2000.

This driver was developed usnig the jTDS 1.2.2 driver.  You can grab
it from sourceforge.net

I've only tested this driver marginally with SQL Server 2005 and not
at all with 2008.  

Known issues:

SQL2k doesn't support rownumber like 2k5 or 2k8 - so there are hacks
to emulate select statements with LIMIT, OFFSET clauses.

SQL2k's transaction support is half baked.  There doesn't seem to be a
completely effective way to produce behaviour equilvalent to
postgresql's deferred constraint behaviour where constraints are 
enforced at COMMIT time but 'dirty' references are allowed inside of
the transaction.

SQL2k's NULL handling is non-standard.  There's a hack to work around
this by creating a schema bound view to enforce ANSI behaviour.
Comments and code can be found in mssql2k.base

zxJDBC or jTDS doesn't like long integer types.  They're forced to
plain integers.  This obviously has real problems. Haven't
investigated a fix yet.

Date vs DateTime fields are handled with a bit of type trickery using
smalldatetime vs datetime.

There are probably tons of other bugs.  This driver may cause damage
to your data. 

Use at your peril.
